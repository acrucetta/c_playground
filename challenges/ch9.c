// CHALLENGE 9 (factorization). Now that weâ€™ve covered functions, see if you can
// imple- ment a program factor that receives a number N on the command line and
// prints out where F0 and so on are all the prime factors of N. The core of
// your implementation should be a function that, given a value of type size_t,
// returns its smallest prime factor. Extend this program to receive a list of
// such numbers and output such a line for each of them.
